On October 19th of 2018, Gojo is asleep and dreams about when he had first met Megumi and what they had discussed that day. 
When Yuji, Megumi, and Nobara arrive, Gojo wakes up and sends them to Utahime's location.
Once the three meet up with Utahime, she tells them about the mole in the school and how they are going to investigate Kokichi Muta.
At the Kyoto School, Miwa meets with Mechamaru about the notebook that they have to turn in. 
Mechamaru tells her where he had left it and that he will be going to sleep for a bit.
Once Mechamaru is asleep, Miwa wonders where the real Mechamaru is at.
At another location, Utahime informs Nobara, Yuji, and Megumi about Kokichi's capabilities in using cursed energy.
When they break into the room that Kokichi is supposedly being held in, they find it empty, learning that he is at another location.
In a separate room entirely, Kokichi meets with Pseudo-Geto and Mahito.
Kokichi comments about how he had thought that they had forgotten about him, which Geto replies that they would never do that since Kokichi knows the consequences of having a cursed restriction.
As Mahito suggests they kill Kokichi since they have the information that they need, Geto tells him that they first have to heal Kokichi before they can kill him due to the terms of the Binding Vow between them. 
Mahito remarks that Kokichi should show some enthusiasm, but Kokichi replies that comes after they settle their business.
Mahito prepares to fight while Kokichi brings out multiple Mechamaru puppets.
As Kokichi sends his puppets at Mahito, Mahito easily destroys them all.
Upon noticing that Kokichi has disappeared, Mahito comments about how he wanted to fight instead of going hunting.
As the floor under Mahito gives away, he heads outside of the dam only to stand facing a giant Mechamaru, revealed as Ultimate Mechamaru Mode: Absolute.
